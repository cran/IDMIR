Description: A systematic biology tool was developed to identify dysregulated miRNAs via a miRNA-miRNA interaction network. 'IDMIR' first constructed a weighted miRNA interaction network through integrating miRNA-target interaction information, molecular function data from Gene Ontology (GO) database and gene transcriptomic data in specific-disease context, and then, it used a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify significantly dysregulated miRNAs.
